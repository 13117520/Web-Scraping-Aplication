I have really enjoyed making this application and learning web scraping which was new to me. 
This application is producing desired JSON output however kcal_per_100g and description fields would still require 
to be manipulated to the expected format. The test coverage could possibly be increased as well. 
Thank you for letting me have go at this fun exercise and learn something new.
